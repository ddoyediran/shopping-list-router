## Shopping List API endpoints

### Description

Building a simple application where we store a shopping list. Using an array to store our items in the shopping list.

Our application should have the following routes:

`GET /items` - this should respond with a list of shopping items.

`POST /items` - this route should accept form data and add it to the shopping list.

`GET /items/:id` - this route should display a single item's name and price.

`PATCH /items/:id` - this route should accept edits to existing items.

`DELETE /items/:id` - this route should allow you to delete a specific item from the array.
